SlippiViewer is a React component that can be used to view slippi replays in the browser.

I took the Viewer from https://github.com/frankborden/slippilab and ripped it out into its own thing as a React component (instead of solid-js).

If you have any issues with this package, or there are new features you'd like to see, please feel free to make your own changes.

USAGE NOTES:
1. You need to copy public/zips into your app's own public/zips folder, I haven't fixed that yet
2. No @types/slippilab-vite
